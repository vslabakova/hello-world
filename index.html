                  <!-- Content -->
                  <p>PROVOCATIVE is a fashion house established in Bulgaria,which produces clothing for women. Founder and creative director of this fashion brand is Gloriya Dimitrova.
</p>

                  <p>By combining modern cuts and sensual fabrics Provocative creates garments for women that give off a casual aura and clear sophisticated minimalism, striving toward pure and timeless aesthetics. High quality craftsmanship is as important to the designer as it is to her client. The lines are clean, smooth and strong with attention to detail. Each piece includes a desire to explore and merge the styles of an era with a contemporary reality. Creating a unique silhouette, inspires elegance and fluidity.
</p>

                  <p>The designer believes that looking attractive is a matter of self-confidence, it is a state of mind. Being elegant does not mean being conspicuous. It means to be sealed in people's minds.
